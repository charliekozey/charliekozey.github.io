      <p>How cool is <a href="https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/culture/public-art/artist-in-residence-keep-art-in-mind-program/1-877-2be-calm-project.html">this</a>? A Victoria, BC public art project designed to bring some auditory comfort when you call the toll-free line. Music, poetry, guided meditation, children's laughter. I actually did feel better after a few minutes of listening.</p>
      <p>Kathryn Calder, the musican who organized this project, is one of my favorite artists; I really appreciate the sincerity and gentle intensity of her music. She's also in the New Pornographers, one of my favorite bands. I had the great pleasure of serendipitously meeting her one April afternoon, and she was <em>so</em> gracious to me, wide-eyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_City">Mary Ann Singleton</a> that I was. I had walked from work to Kathryn's show at Hotel Utah in San Francisco, and I had arrived early because I planned on getting a quick dinner at the venue. I put in my order and headed back to the small seating area at the end of the bar, and I did a literal double take when I realized she was sitting there at one of the tables. I remember thanking her for her music and probably oversharing about my dead mom. At some point she mentioned that she was reading <em>My Brilliant Friend</em> by Elena Ferrante. We discussed El Farolito, a classic SF burrito place, and she said that she misses out on much of the excitement over their burritos since she's a vegetarian. I'm pretty sure that was the moment I decided to revive my own lapsed vegetarianism.</p>
