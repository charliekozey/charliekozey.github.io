       This page is where I gather these little things, a somewhat haphazard collection of thoughts and items that I find to be worth remembering and sharing.

       It continues!! "Patience," the Yvette Young riff featured in my last post, has been <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kKAtPTgmeo">updated</a> with a jangly acoustic sound and a new section. I enjoy the slower and more even pacing of this version.

       I recommend listening to <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Mt0lMW1fCw">this little riff</a> by Yvette Young, guitarist of the band Covet. It's one of those bits of music that (to me at least) evokes joy and longing at the same time, and I'm such a sucker for that kind of thing. I'm excited to see if it becomes a song eventually, but for now I'll just keep playing this clip over and over.

     <p>How cool is this? A <a href="https://www.victoria.ca/EN/main/residents/culture/public-art/artist-in-residence-keep-art-in-mind-program/1-877-2be-calm-project.html">Victoria, BC public art project</a> designed to bring some auditory comfort when you call the toll-free line. Music, poetry, guided meditation, children's laughter. I actually did feel better after a few minutes of listening.</p>
     <p>Kathryn Calder, the musican who organized this project, is one of my favorite artists; I love the sincerity and gentle intensity of her music. She's also in the New Pornographers, one of my favorite bands. I had the great pleasure of serendipitously meeting her one April afternoon, and she was <em>so</em> gracious to me, wide-eyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_the_City">Mary Ann Singleton</a> that I was. </p>
     <p>I had walked from work to Kathryn Calder's show at Hotel Utah in San Francisco, and I had arrived early because I planned on getting a quick dinner at the venue. I put in my order and headed back to the small seating area at the end of the bar, and I did a literal double take when I realized she was sitting there at one of the tables. Not running late, not hanging out backstage (although, now that I think about it, maybe there *is* no backstage at Hotel Utah), just sitting there like a normal person, waiting for her own show.</p>
     <p>I remember thanking her for her music and probably oversharing about dead mom stuff. At some point she mentioned that she was reading <em>My Brilliant Friend</em> by Elena Ferrante. We discussed El Farolito, a classic SF burrito place, and she said that she misses out on much of the excitement over their burritos since she's a vegetarian. I'm pretty sure that was the moment I decided to revive my own lapsed vegetarianism (though I do miss those burritos sometimes).</p>
