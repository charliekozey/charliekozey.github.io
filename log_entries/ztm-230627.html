            <h3 id="what">What?</h3>
            <p>Today I’m kicking off my work on this free guide by Andrei Neagoie:
                <a href="https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-for-free/">Learn to
                    Code for Free, Get Hired in 5 Months</a>.
            </p>
            <h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Learn in public: Learning is fun, and I want to get better at
                        sharing my process with others
                </li>
                <li>
                    Improve: Become a better developer so I can better support my
                        students in their learning and in their job searches, and maybe even get
                        a dev job myself if I decide to do that one day
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pre-selected resources: Expose myself to a wide range of
                        sequenced resources that have already been curated (because there’s so
                        much out there to wade through!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Find inspiration: Find examples of teaching techniques and
                        resources to add to my toolbox and/or share with students
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="how">How?</h3>
            <p>I’ve made a simplified version of the guide at <a
                    href="https://github.com/charliekozey/ztm-progress">this GitHub
                    repo</a>
                where I can track my progress and keep my practice code organized.
                There’s also a blank version of the checklist if you’d like to follow
                along!</p>
            <p>Over the coming weeks, I’ll be writing brief check-ins on my progress
                and sharing them here. My goal is to spend at least 10 minutes every
                weekday on learning: small and consistent building blocks that will
                compound over time.</p>
            <h3 id="first-up-the-big-picture-html-css">First Up: The Big Picture +
                HTML + CSS</h3>
            <p>I’ve already learned a lot of the content in this program, especially
                in the first month, so I don’t anticipate it will actually take the full
                length of time. But I really want to shore up my foundations, so I do plan to at least skim each resource or spend a few
                minutes reviewing it (as in the case of my dear old pal <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">Flexbox
                    Froggy</a>)
                to
                see if there
                are any gaps it can help me fill in.</p>
            <p>I plan to spend the bulk of my efforts in this section on computer
                networking and computer science fundamentals, particularly the <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y62zj9ozPOM&amp;list=PLhQjrBD2T3828ZVcVzEIhsHVgjANGZveu">Harvard
                    CS50 course</a>, since my training as a bootcamp grad has been pretty
                nuts-and-bolts. I’m looking forward to diving in to the more conceptual
                stuff!</p>
            <p>I’ll also spend a decent chunk of time on the “How to Learn” section, to
                make the process a little more efficient, and to identify nuggets of
                wisdom to share with my students on their learning journeys.</p>
