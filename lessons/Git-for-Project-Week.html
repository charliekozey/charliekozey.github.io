          # GitHub for First Project Week

          ---
          ## Goals:
          Be able to...
          - Create a git repository and a GitHub repository (and know the difference!)
          - Add collaborators to your repo
          - Collaborate on GitHub with the GitHub flow:
            - Create branches
            - Push, merge, and pull
          - Resolve merge conflicts

          ---
          ## Remember!
          - merge conflicts will happen
          - confusion will happen
          - it's all part of the process
          - fear not!

          ---
          ## Creating a repository
          Option One: starting from local
          - get github command line interface
          - create repository from the terminal
          - inside your project folder, run:
          ```bash
          git init
          gh repo create
          ```
          - then follow the prompts

          ---
          Option Two: starting from remote (github.com)
          - create a new repository
          - then clone it down

          ---
          ### Adding collaborators

          ## Orienting yourself

          - ```git status``` shows current branch and recent changed files
          - ```git log``` shows past commits
          - ```git diff``` shows difference between present state and staged files

          ---
          ## Orienting yourself, continued
          - highly recommended: use [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

          ## No pushing to main

          Repeat after me: I WILL NOT PUSH TO MAIN

          ---
          ## Pull requests
          - On open-source projects and in your future jobs, your PRs will need approval from project leaders
          - In the case of your projects, you're playing the role of submitter AND approver

          ---
          ## GitHub Collaboration Flow:

          [More details on GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)

          ![github-flow-diagram.png](assets/github-flow-diagram.png)

          ---
          Once you've created or cloned your project repo...

          Step 1. Go to main branch: ```git checkout main```

          Step 2. Pull most updated version of main: ```git pull origin main```

          ---
          Step 3. Create new branch with your name and the feature you're about to work on, for example:
          ```bash
          git checkout -b charlie/form-submission
          ```

          This creates the new branch and switches you onto it. [Use this resource for github branch naming restrictions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/dealing-with-special-characters-in-branch-and-tag-names)

          ---
          Step 4. Work on your feature

          Step 5. Use ```git status``` to see a list of changed files and which branch you're on. It's recommended to use this feature often to stay oriented!

          Step 6. ```git diff``` is also a friend: shows you what's changed since last commit

          ---
          Step 7. When you're done, ```git add``` to ***stage*** the files you worked on, for example:
          ```bash
          git add src/index.js style.css
          ```

          Step 8. ***Commit*** your changes with a descriptive message in the present tense, for example:
          ```bash
          git commit -m "add new item form to inventory page"
          ```

          ---
          > A commit is like a save point in a video game

          ---
          Step 9. Push this change from your local branch to the same branch on remote:
          ```bash
          git push origin charlie/form-submission
          ```

          Step 10. When you're ready to integrate the changes, go to github.com and make a pull request to merge your working branch into the main branch.

          Step 11. Resolve any merge conflicts (github will prompt you and pull up an editor if so), and then complete the merge.

          ---
          Step 12. This branch has done its job. You can delete it, or keep your branch as a record of what you've built so far. I recommend keeping it. Just don't re-use it, that will probably cause headaches.

          Step 13. Start back at 1 and build a new feature (or improve an existing one)!

          ---
          ## Once again
          - merge conflicts will happen
          - confusion will happen
          - it's all part of the process
          - fear not!
