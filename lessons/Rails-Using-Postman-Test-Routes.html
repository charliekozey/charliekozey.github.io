				## Using Postman to Test Rails Routes
				---
				## Goals:
				- Be able to access backend data with GET requests in Postman
				- Be able to add and change data with POST and PATCH requests
				- Be able to diagnose and fix common errors
					- server not running
					- no route matches "X"
					- no method error
				- Be able to organize your Postman requests into collections for easy access
				---
				## Review: Rails Routing and Browser Requests
				- What does a Rails route do? What layer of MVC does it occupy?
				- Which files are the key players in setting up a Rails route?
				- How do you set up a route in Rails?
				- How can you use your browser to test that your server is running and has the correct data?
				---
				## Why Postman?
				- You can use browser to test GET requests (index and show)
				- But you can't test POST, PATCH, or DELETE requests (create, update, and destroy, respectively) without
				a functioning front end
				- Postman is a tool that lets you do that
				---
				## Key tips
				- Configure your request as Body > raw > JSON, like so:
				![screenshot highlighting the request config options: Body, raw,
				JSON](assets/postman-request-config.jpg)
				---
				## Key tips
				- Save your requests to access them later
				- Collections > New Collection > Add Request

				request](assets/postman-organize-requests.jpg)
