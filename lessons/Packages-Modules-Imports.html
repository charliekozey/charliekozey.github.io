				## Python Packages, Modules, and Imports
				![[the PyPI logo: a python logo constructed out of cubes]](assets/pypi-logo.svg "PyPI logo")
				---
				## Goals
				You will be able to:
				* use ```pipenv install``` to install the packages your project needs and spin up a virtual python
				environment
				* use the ```import``` keyword to combine functions, classes, and modules in order to accomplish larger
				tasks
				---
				## Review
				* What is a dependency?
				* Why might we want to break up our application code into multiple files?
				* Where have you come across packages and dependencies before?
				---
				## Modules
				![[a pile of disconnected lego blocks]](assets/lego-modules.jpg "modules are like individual
				legos")
				* A module is a ```.py``` file that defines methods and variables
				* Can be imported by other files
				* Collection of modules = package
				---
				### Python's built-in modules
				* can also build your own, but check here first:
				* [Python Module Index](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html)
				---
				## Packages
				![[a model plane made out of legos]](assets/lego-package.jpg "packages are like things you build
				with legos")
				* AKA libraries
				* Save time
				* Help us not reinvent the wheel
				---
				### Getting packages
				* Distribution package --> like an npm module
				* found on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (the **Py**thon **P**ackage **I**ndex)
				* ```pip```: command line tool for installing and managing packages from PyPI
				---
				## Virtual environment
				![[a workshop with tools for woodworking]](assets/workshop-tools.jpg)
				![[a studio with tools for pottery]](assets/pottery-studio.jpg)
				* Creates an isolated container for your current project's packages
				---
				### Pyenv
				* manages Python versions
				* (like nvm)
				---
				### [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
				* Manages dependencies (packages your project depends on)
				* Helps prevent dependency conflicts
				* Does lots of the setup for you
				* ```pipenv install``` is like ```npm install```
				* creates ```Pipfile.lock``` --> from ```Pipfile```
				---
				## The ```import``` keyword
				* Where have you seen this before?
				---

					```jsx
					// App.js ////////////////////////////

					import Gallery from './Gallery.js';
					import Header from './Header.js';
	
					function App() {
					    return (
						    <Header />
						    <Gallery />
					    );
					}
	
					export default App;
					```
				</textarea>
				---
				### Import syntax
				```py
				import some_module
				# this imports all the function and variable definitions from some_module

				from some_module import specific_function
				# this imports just one specified function from some_module

				from some_module import *
				# this imports everything from some_module
				# not the recommended approach (why might that be?)
				```
				---
				### Absolute imports
				#### use these most of the time
				* Given a ```some_package``` package in the same root project directory as ```app.py```
				```py
				### app.py ############################
				from some_package.nested_module import some_function
				```
				---
				### Relative imports
				#### use when absolute import gets unwieldy
				1. Import each successive child in each separate file (like you would for React components)
				2. Then call the function in the original parent by chaining with periods:
				```py
				some_package.subpackage1.module2.func1()
				```
				---
