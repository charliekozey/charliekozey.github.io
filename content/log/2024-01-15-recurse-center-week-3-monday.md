<!-- title: Recurse Center Week 3: Monday Jan 15 -->

Built breadcrumb navigation into my website.

  - Was more complicated than I'd anticipated!
  - Feel sort of embarrassed that that was the edge of my abilities, but there it is.
  - On the bright side, I'm realizing I feel way more comfortable than I used to about diving into a repo of pre-existing code and changing things. I used to be so afraid of breaking something, but now I have a lot more confidence that I can figure out what the code is actually doing and how the parts fit together.
  - Would like to write a blog post about it (both how I came up with the solution, and how I feel like a less brittle programmer now, if that makes sense. Maybe two different posts.)
