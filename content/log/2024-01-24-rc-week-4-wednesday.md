Leetcode: Ransom note

  - Ransom Note in Python in 40 minutes
  - Speed and memory were pretty good!
  - Got my first exposure to Swift, which apparently has something called inouts, which are arguments that can be mutated in a function and stay mutated in subsequent function calls. Weird!

  - shoutout to the recurser who got us the free credits to share, and to Liz for giving me the heads up about it!
