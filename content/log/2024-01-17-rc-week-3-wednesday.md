<!-- title: Recurse Center Week 3: Wed Jan 17 -->

Creative coding

   - theme: "with great power comes great responsibility"
   - attempted spiderman web shooter in three.js with Alex
   - didn't get far but learned stuff:
     - intro to setting up three.js, the docs are nice!
     - a physics engine: ammo.js, built on c++ physics engine called bullet
     - I probably spent too much time getting distracted with different possible avenues, like the gui editor on three.js
       - would have helped to plan more before diving in
   - also enjoyed chatting with Alex
   - the other projects were v cool, esp. Ivy and Reed's drag-and-drop webpage modifier
   - learned about the multibrot set and the global power plant database from Julian

Chat with David

   - he's trying to make the [prison realm](https://jujutsu-kaisen.fandom.com/wiki/Prison_Realm) in three.js
   - ran into the same issues getting started as me, solved them by using webpack
   - enthusiastic about synthia, wants to test
   - discussed synthia audience: niche nerds or maximally accessible?
      - decided on accessible
   - wants to pair on tone.js
   - working on bittorrent client

Learned more about open source stuff

- Zulip stream #oss-at-rc is a goldmine
- Sumana Harihareswara's articles:
  - [2014](https://www.harihareswara.net/posts/2014/some-help-for-new-open-source-people/)
    - "The rhythm of help": you ask someone, they send a doc, you read the doc and find you have a new question, you collaborate with the person on improving the doc
  - [2022](https://www.harihareswara.net/posts/2022/i-want-to-start-contributing-to-open-source-my-current-advice/)
    - don't start with PRs, start with testing old open issues, and reporting back
- Started reading [Open Advice](http://www.open-advice.org/Open-Advice.pdf)
- Made longlist of possible projects, will investigate tomorrow and narrow down to shortlist based on languages, beginner-friendliness, and general vibe
