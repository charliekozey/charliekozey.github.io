<!-- title: Recurse Center Week 2: Mon Jan 08 -->

Was a whirlwind of meeting people, chatting, and getting to know the space at the RC hub.

I slept badly last night, so I worry I didn't make the best impression.

But the space is so cool and everyone's so nice and I also got Xi'an Famous Foods with P.B. which was excellent. Onward!
