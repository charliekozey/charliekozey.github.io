<!--title: Recurse Center Week 3: Tue Jan 16-->

Attended [Zack](https://zackscholl.com/)'s SuperCollider workshop on making drones, which was extremely cool.

  - Love his teaching approach using [annotated code](https://github.com/schollz/workshops/blob/main/2021-08-music-hackspace-supercollider/droning/part1.scd); I think it encourages hands-on learning.
  - Spent several hours working through his tutorials and experimenting.
  
Feeling some pressure to make progress on Synthia, but practicing using my volitional muscles and feeling like it's a good time for a break.

To that end, I did some "finger work": wrote a shell script to automatically generate a markdown file from the contents of the clipboard.

  - Overarching goal: trying to reduce friction to publishing on this site. Been meaning to be more active on it!
  - Perhaps even more so than yesterday, feeling sort of embarrassed that a bash script is the edge of my abilities.
  - I know it was the edge because I had an idea of how to start, and then had to do lots of searching online to fumble my way around bash.
  - But I feel accomplishedâ€”it never stops being fun just getting something to *work*, and it actually has been really helpful already!
  - And now I'm extra motivated to publish to the site.
