<!-- RC Week 4 Day 1: Mon Jan 22 2024 -->

## Mon Jan 21 2024 (RC W4 Mon)

Easing back into things todayâ€”have been feeling pretty stuck lately and just getting the wheels moving again.

- Attended checkins with Taniya, Jeff, and a few others
	- Was helpful to hear that some other people have gotten stuck too
	- Great just to connect with people, plan to keep attending
- Responded to Zulip messages
- Caught up on a few threads
- Went to leetcode group; Vedashree and Justina went over their approaches to Set Mismatch and Alan taught me a lot about breadth-first search as we worked on Flood Fill
