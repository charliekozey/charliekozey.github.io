<!-- title: Recurse Center Week 5: Tue Jan 30 -->

Brain feels extra depleted this afternoon, possibly because the day has been full of zoom meetings. Didn't go to the hub.

SuperCollider Workshop

  - On manipulating samples
  - Can take mouse input for XY params with `.poll()`, very cool!

Zoom with Kevin

  - Good chat about music, his phd, traveling, the game of life
  
Leetcode: Number of 1 Bits

  - I think the problem was confusing as written; the test cases seem to be saying that the input is a binary string, but it's actually the equivalent integer.
  - Once I got that sorted out, getting a working solution wasn't too hard (less than 5 minutes).
  - Looking at the more optimal solutions, I see that bit manipulation is probably the thing to doâ€”will return to that when my brain is a little more fresh since bitwise operators are new to me.
