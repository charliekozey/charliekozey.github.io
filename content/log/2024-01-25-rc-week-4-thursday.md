<!-- title: Recurse Center Week 4: Thu Jan 25 -->

Did a bit of a reassessment the last few days and shifted my goals somewhat:

New goals!

1. do a problem from grind 75 every day
	- sign of success: be able to do medium-level problems consistently within the recommended time limit
	- also want to read and practice all of the entries from the techinterviewhandbook algorithms cheat sheet, be able to summarize each one
2. learn a new stack: react with typescript, django, firebase, AWS
   - sign of success: contribute some significant improvement to an existing app with that stack

Connecting

- went to checkins
- officially extended to a full batch!
- took a walk with P.B.
- had a lunch chat with Alex and Sareena, discussed NYC vs. Seattle
  
Leetcode: Majority Element (easy)

  - JS basic object implementation
    - first pass in under 20 minutes (yay!)
    - first pass was O(n) space (I think?) (6%) and O(n) time (16%) (not great)
  - learned differences between JS objects and Maps:
    - from [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/map-vs-object-in-javascript/):
   
  > 1. In Object, the data-type of the key-field is restricted to integer, strings, and symbols. Whereas in Map, the key-field can be of any data-type (integer, an array, even an object!)
  > 2. In the Map, the original order of elements is preserved. This is not true in case of objects.
  > 3. The Map is an instance of an object but the vice-versa is not true.

  - JS Map() implementation (second attempt)
    - significantly better (66%) time 
    - slightly better space (8%)

  - seek out even better implementations?
  
Went to presentations!

  - 3 random takeaways:  
    1.  MTA API only accounts for 2 directions, which leads to some ambiguity, which mirrors my real life confusion (I can't tell you the number of times I've gone the wrong way on the G after transferring from the C at Hoyt-Schermerhorn lolol)
    2. there's a whole world of local-first apps, seems cool: localfirstweb.dev
    3. TypeScript playground: a place to explore differences in transcompilation into different versions of JS
