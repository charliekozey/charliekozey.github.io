<!-- title: Recurse Center Week 2: Thursday Jan 11 -->

Attended the first presentations of the batch. Learned about a bunch of things I had never heard of!

  - Zach Ahn (Safari web extension)
  - Quinten (Rust raycaster)
  - Roger (How transformers work) 
  - Pietro (Nim)
  - Thomas (XML Chaos to Nix Clarity)
  - Jeff (Memory card creator)
  - Julian (Owntracks ‚Äî walking tracker, distance and elevation)

Random interesting things I took away from them:

  - Transformer ML architecture led to breakthroughs in language translation. (Roger)
  - Really like Roger's inclusion of takeaway lessons, hope to steal sometime.
  - Bret Victor was the one who first conceived of Explorable Explanations. (Pietro)
  - Jeff's reflections on pixiereport include a list of "learning edges" which is awesome, also hope to steal.
  - Elevation tracker: best not to use phone position (too inaccurate), rather use lat and long to lookup on elevation table ‚Äî lots of cool libraries for this. (Julian)

Worked some more on containerizing Synthia.
   - A victory of focus: was tempted to completely overhaul the project's file structure, but I resisted. üí™üèª
