<!-- title: Recurse Center Week 4: Fri Jan 26 -->

Overall a much better week! Finally feel like I have my legs under me.

- checkins
- paired with Ko on synthia CORS issue
  - got as far as learning that flask_cors doesn't support wildcard origins for supports_credentials (which is probably wise of them, just inconvenient for me :P )
- paired with P.B. on her interactive fiction project
  - inform: a language and ide for interactive fiction
  - so cool!! definitely has piqued my interest in literate programming
  - together we got an opening scene done for her new story
- leetcode
  - Implement Queue Using Stacks (easy) - Python 91% 59%
    - 50 minutes
    - spent a lot of it wondering what the problem was actually asking for, and probably overthinking
    - spent another chunk of it frustrated that leetcode wouldn't accept the splat operator, not realizing I needed to use Python3 instead of Python (ugh)
    - but we eventually prevailed!
