<!-- title: First day at the Recurse Center -->

### Meeting everyone

Introductions via Zoom and Zulip have been *overwhelming* but I really enjoyed learning about what everyone's working on, and the vibes have been 100% positive.

I was pleasantly surprised that a number of people seemed excited about the idea of a social synth app, which feels really nice! (I *will* be reaching out to all of you for collaboration and testing purposes; consider this your conscription üòÇ)

### The rest is still unwritten

Today I attended the first half of Creative Coding (run by Jen, thanks Jen!). In the spirit of the new year, today's prompt was "the rest is still unwritten." Jen, Dan, and I had a brainstorming session to design a rest tracker terminal app as a complement (antidote?) to productivity trackers. Dan and I had to hop out for one of our core introductory meetings, so it was up to Jen to build the thing, which turned out very cool and which you can find [here](https://github.com/jovisly/RC-CreativeCoding/tree/main/rest-tracker).

Things I learned about in the process:
- OpenAI integration
- Examples of really good ChatGPT prompts
- Reading/writing to a json file with Python
- Got a small taste of the quasi-natural-language weirdness of AppleScript

### Feeling slow üê¢

I'm feeling sort of self-conscious about how long it takes me to build things. I think the main culprits are 1. self-doubt/perfectionism and 2. being easily distracted. (*Zulip! Blogs! Other people's projects! Should I use a library for this? Oh I gotta install this dependency first. Should I scrap everything and start over?* etc.)

Fortunately, the collective momentum of pair programming‚Äîthough somewhat intimidating‚Äîis really good for enforcing focus and removing time for self-doubt. Which gives me hope!

Here are some things I'm going to do to keep my momentum going:

- Set timers/use pomodoros
- Set a small doable goal for the hour (or whatever interval)
- During rest intervals, quickly jot down what I accomplished in the previous work block
- Keep project scopes narrow
- Do more pairing
- Make it fun! Don't worry so much!

Otherwise, I'm just trying to remind myself that speed isn't everything.
